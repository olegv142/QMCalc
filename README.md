# QMCalc

## Quantum mechanical calculations of the electron and holes energy levels in 2D quantum well.

This code was originally written more than 2 decades ago. It was used for example for calculations presented in the following article:

*O.V.Volkov, V.E.Zhitomirskii, I.V.Kukushkin, W.Dietsche, K.v. Klitzing, A.Fischer and K.Eberl, "Magnetooptical spectroscopy of two-dimensional holes in GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions", Phys.Rev.B 56, 7541 (1997).*

You can find it in the doc folder.

The code has 2 major parts - expression evaluator for the model parameters input and Numerical Receipts inspired code for Schroedinger equation solving.
Currently compiled by Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.
